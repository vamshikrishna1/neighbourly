The Neighbourly platform has 4 aspects

1. Community Engagement
2. Ecommerce
3. Service Listing
4. Contact US


1. Community Engagement
    1. Event calendar
    2. Forums/Discussion boards
    3. static content about the community 
            1. Rules and regulations
            2. some important contacts like the commitee members
            3. Doctors available in the community

    4. Blogging

2. E-commerce:
    its basically like a buy/sell group.
    A community member can post the item for sale and anybody can view the item and its details and share his/her interest with the seller.
    Only verified community members or Authorized Sellers can only sell the items in our platform.
    Item can be new or resale.

3. Service Listing:
        which basically means promoting the internal business like someone taking dance classes within the community.
        Through this app, we will post the Ads and promote their businesses.
        Dance classes is one such example. But it could be like someone is a financial advisor or a lawyer living in the community.
        Posting their Ads would help their Business and also improves the connectivity within the community and the residents within the community can also trust the business as he/she aslo resides in the same community.
