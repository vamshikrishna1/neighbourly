Neighbourly was founded by Vamshi Krishna Yerramalla, resident of Marina Skies — a gated community in Hyderabad — and Srinivasa Prasad Ghantasala, Managing Director of GI Solutions.

What started as a simple frustration —
“Why can’t I find a plumber without asking four WhatsApp groups?” —
quickly grew into a mission.

In a sea of daily messages, important questions often go unanswered. And while neighbouring communities are just a few steps away, there’s no reliable way to connect with them — wwhether it’s for finding a better service, accessing a broader marketplace, or getting timely help.

Neighbourly was born to fix this —
A platform to simplify everyday needs, reduce noise, and bring together not just your society — but nearby communities too — for a bigger, better shared experience.
