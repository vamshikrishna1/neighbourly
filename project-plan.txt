1. Set Up the Foundation (Dev Environment)
Set up GitHub repo or monorepo structure

Install & configure:

Java 17+

Spring Boot CLI (or Spring Initializr)

PostgreSQL (or use H2 locally first)

Docker (for DBs or multi-service test)

Create a workspace like:

rust
Copy
Edit
neighborly-backend/
├── auth-service/
├── user-service/
├── community-service/ (empty for now)
├── marketplace-service/ (empty for now)
└── docker-compose.yml (optional for DB setup)
✅ 2. Start with auth-service
Handles all login logic — OTP, JWT, and token issuing.

🔨 Build:

/auth/send-otp

/auth/verify-otp

JWT generation

Token structure: userId, phone, role, communityId

➡️ Needed by every other service.

✅ 3. Build user-service
Stores core user data and handles:

User profile

Flat + community mapping

Role management

RWA/admin approval flow

🔨 Build:

/users/by-phone

/users (create)

/users/{id}/flat (map to flat)

Entities: User, Flat, Community

➡️ Needed by auth-service (to fetch/create user post OTP).

✅ 4. Integrate auth-service with user-service
After OTP verify → auth-service checks/creates user via REST

Passes JWT token with claims

Ensure token validation is working in user-service

⏭️ 5. Add community-service scaffolding
Start with just endpoints:

/events

/forums

/service-listings

No business logic yet — just set it up and make sure requests route properly.

⏭️ 6. Add marketplace-service scaffolding
Base endpoints:

/items (buy/sell)

/catalog/share

Entity stubs: Item, ItemCategory, Offer

Add simple DTOs and mock controller responses.

✅ 7. Set up API Gateway (Optional at this stage)
Use Spring Cloud Gateway to route:

/auth/** → auth-service

/users/** → user-service

etc.

Use JWT token validation at gateway level (or defer for now).

✅ 8. Prepare for Prelaunch UI (Optional)
If your app UI is also under development:

Provide working endpoints for login, user onboarding

Offer mock responses for marketplace and events

Use Swagger/OpenAPI for testing

🧠 So, Where Should You Start?
✅ Start with auth-service + user-service integration.
Once that works end-to-end (user can register/login and be tracked with JWT), you're in a powerful position to expand horizontally.
