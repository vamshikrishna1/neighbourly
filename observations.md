24. Allowing Verified Members(Email) to post products and services on our platform can lead to SPAM.Either their should be a approval process or we should remove access to the verified members to buy the license on our platform. Verified members/outsiders need to contact us through our contact us page to buy the subscription and post a Service on our platform.
Verfied Neighbours can buy the license from our platform directly but we should not allow an email verified memeber to post a service or an item for sale directly on our platform
